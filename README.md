##  Tech Stack

Implementing a component-based architecture using **React.js** and **React-Bootstrap** made it possible to deploy in a short time, a modern and design-responsible website. With **Vite** as a building tool for React applications, the development process was surprisingly fast and smooth.

For styling, the integration of **SCSS** and **Bootstrap** ensures a flexible way of styling while assuring the application fits different screen sizes and devices.
##  Development Goals

- Create a functional Web Portfolio in 10 days.
- Utilize React.js and React-Bootstrap.
- Integrate Bootstrap with personal SCSS styling.
- Showcase the brand identity, info and products.
